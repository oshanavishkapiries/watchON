WEBVTT

00:13:06.368 --> 00:13:08.954
Elon, doesn't this deserve a dance today?

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.466
Oh yeah,
I might be living up there in two weeks.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.594
Remember when you saw Mommy on this thing?

00:43:58.677 --> 00:43:59.677
Yeah.

00:49:41.353 --> 00:49:43.230
In terms of what, when you say hold?

00:49:47.901 --> 00:49:50.278
So depending on when
and how it plays itself out,

00:49:50.362 --> 00:49:52.447
we'd probably be cutting to a wide shot

00:49:52.531 --> 00:49:54.324
and watching this thing happen.

00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:57.035
We couldn't cut away.

00:49:59.538 --> 00:50:00.622
Couldn't cut away.

00:57:43.918 --> 00:57:45.628
I shouldn't have eaten breakfast.

00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:47.964
It's a stress-eating kind of day.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:26.868
So we're gonna make sure
all your zippers are closed,

01:02:26.951 --> 01:02:27.951
minus your gloves.

01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:29.579
Good?

01:03:01.235 --> 01:03:03.821
Okay, I just wanna double-check.
Who's doing the measurement?

01:03:04.405 --> 01:03:05.281
The Range.

01:03:05.364 --> 01:03:07.200
Yeah, great, but who at the Range?

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:09.535
Uh, the Launch Weather Officer.

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:12.371
And basically, we communicate
with the weather office.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.792
They're the ones that basically
make the call on the Range weather.

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:23.591
Mike's gonna call it right now.

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:34.346
That's it.

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:36.264
It's aborted?

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.021
It's not our day.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:47.401
Basically,
we've got ten major weather rules,

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:49.695
and three of them
are in violation right now.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:50.779
Three?

01:05:51.864 --> 01:05:55.409
At least eyeballing it, this does not look
like we should be stopping launch.

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:58.453
We just wanna make sure

01:05:58.496 --> 01:06:00.790
we're not scrubbing
based on weather that's half-hour-old.

01:06:00.873 --> 01:06:04.085
The measurement's real-time.
It's real-time lightning.

01:06:05.544 --> 01:06:09.006
We just wanna make sure it's real
and we're not jumping at shadows.

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:13.094
So next launch time is Saturday.

01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:12.922
Hey, buddy, I love you.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.759
You bet. This is gonna be cool.

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:19.804
Be good for Mommy.

01:08:22.389 --> 01:08:23.389
See you, buddy.

01:08:26.143 --> 01:08:28.395
Hey, Theo, you be on good behavior, okay?

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:31.273
And enjoy today.
Watch the rocket for me, okay?

01:08:32.858 --> 01:08:34.735
I'll call you from the space station.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:38.531
Okay, you're welcome.

01:08:40.741 --> 01:08:41.741
I love you.

01:09:55.774 --> 01:09:57.109
What's up, Elon?

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:58.736
Looking a little nicer today.

01:09:58.819 --> 01:10:00.196
It looks really nice.

01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:02.489
Oh, palo santo.

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:05.868
I like it. Anything you can do.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.787
It's for good luck.

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.874
For situations like this,
you can't have too much luck.

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:13.709
You believe in luck?

01:10:14.293 --> 01:10:16.253
I believe luck is the best superpower.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:20.966
If you can have any superpower,
luck is the one you'd want.

01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:36.690
All right.

01:10:36.774 --> 01:10:38.108
Holy shit, here we go.

01:13:07.091 --> 01:13:09.301
That's real, dude. That's space!

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:13.680
It only takes nine minutes
to get to orbit.

01:13:13.764 --> 01:13:16.558
Nine minutes, and you're going
25 times the speed of sound.

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:20.020
Bob and Doug are cool as cucumbers.

01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:22.564
It looks too smooth.

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.234
Two dads.

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.237
Dads in space.

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:27.482
- It's kind of dark out here, Chris.
- Yeah, it's kind of dark.

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.223
Is there any good news about this?

01:33:24.307 --> 01:33:26.976
Sounds scary, Bob.
You sure you wanna do that?

01:33:27.643 --> 01:33:29.520
- Obviously.
- Obviously.

01:48:09.483 --> 01:48:11.485
How long until they hit the atmosphere?

01:48:11.568 --> 01:48:13.778
They go into the sequence in five minutes.

01:48:13.862 --> 01:48:15.655
I'm actually here for the deorbit burn.

01:48:16.156 --> 01:48:17.616
To make sure that goes well.

01:48:18.158 --> 01:48:19.826
- Deorbit burn's coming up now?
- Yeah.

01:48:24.789 --> 01:48:26.666
Everything's looking good, I think.

01:48:28.919 --> 01:48:31.379
Yeah, well, it certainly has been
quite a journey.

01:48:31.463 --> 01:48:33.673
Crazy. Here we are, right?

01:48:34.883 --> 01:48:36.092
Yes, 18 years.

01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:39.221
- Are you nervous?
- Yeah, I am.

01:48:55.529 --> 01:48:58.156
Cool as a cucumber
because they're not breathing very heavy,

01:48:58.240 --> 01:48:59.783
because their CO2 is not going up.

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:00.866
That's good.

01:49:29.521 --> 01:49:31.356
Four G's. That's moving.

01:49:32.274 --> 01:49:33.775
Almost like a little comet.

01:52:31.244 --> 01:52:33.329
And we're back to seven meters per second.

01:52:33.413 --> 01:52:34.413
Nothing.

01:52:34.456 --> 01:52:35.790
It's, like, sitting there.

01:58:52.875 --> 01:58:53.960
Hey, Mommy!

01:58:59.465 --> 01:59:00.591
Hi, buddy!

01:59:00.675 --> 01:59:02.385
Hey, Mommy, I love you.

01:59:25.783 --> 01:59:26.909
See you in six months.

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:28.953
See you in six months. I'm gonna miss you.

02:00:52.370 --> 02:00:54.413
Elon, are you go?

02:00:54.497 --> 02:00:55.748
Absolutely.

02:00:55.831 --> 02:00:59.126
MJ, we're here.
We just spoke to Elon. He's ready to go.
