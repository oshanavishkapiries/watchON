1
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,954
Elon, doesn't this deserve a dance today?

2
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,466
Oh yeah,
I might be living up there in two weeks.

3
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,594
Remember when you saw Mommy on this thing?

4
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,677
Yeah.

5
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,230
In terms of what, when you say hold?

6
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,278
So depending on when
and how it plays itself out,

7
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,447
we'd probably be cutting to a wide shot

8
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,324
and watching this thing happen.

9
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,035
We couldn't cut away.

10
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,622
Couldn't cut away.

11
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,628
I shouldn't have eaten breakfast.

12
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,964
It's a stress-eating kind of day.

13
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,868
So we're gonna make sure
all your zippers are closed,

14
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:27,951
minus your gloves.

15
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:29,579
Good?

16
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,821
Okay, I just wanna double-check.
Who's doing the measurement?

17
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:05,281
The Range.

18
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:07,200
Yeah, great, but who at the Range?

19
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,535
Uh, the Launch Weather Officer.

20
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,371
And basically, we communicate
with the weather office.

21
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:15,792
They're the ones that basically
make the call on the Range weather.

22
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,591
Mike's gonna call it right now.

23
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,346
That's it.

24
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,264
It's aborted?

25
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,021
It's not our day.

26
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:47,401
Basically,
we've got ten major weather rules,

27
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,695
and three of them
are in violation right now.

28
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:50,779
Three?

29
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:55,409
At least eyeballing it, this does not look
like we should be stopping launch.

30
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:58,453
We just wanna make sure

31
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,790
we're not scrubbing
based on weather that's half-hour-old.

32
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:04,085
The measurement's real-time.
It's real-time lightning.

33
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:09,006
We just wanna make sure it's real
and we're not jumping at shadows.

34
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,094
So next launch time is Saturday.

35
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:12,922
Hey, buddy, I love you.

36
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,759
You bet. This is gonna be cool.

37
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:19,804
Be good for Mommy.

38
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:23,389
See you, buddy.

39
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:28,395
Hey, Theo, you be on good behavior, okay?

40
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:31,273
And enjoy today.
Watch the rocket for me, okay?

41
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:34,735
I'll call you from the space station.

42
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,531
Okay, you're welcome.

43
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:41,741
I love you.

44
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:57,109
What's up, Elon?

45
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,736
Looking a little nicer today.

46
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:00,196
It looks really nice.

47
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,489
Oh, palo santo.

48
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,868
I like it. Anything you can do.

49
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,787
It's for good luck.

50
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,874
For situations like this,
you can't have too much luck.

51
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,709
You believe in luck?

52
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,253
I believe luck is the best superpower.

53
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,966
If you can have any superpower,
luck is the one you'd want.

54
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:36,690
All right.

55
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,108
Holy shit, here we go.

56
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:09,301
That's real, dude. That's space!

57
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,680
It only takes nine minutes
to get to orbit.

58
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:16,558
Nine minutes, and you're going
25 times the speed of sound.

59
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:20,020
Bob and Doug are cool as cucumbers.

60
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:22,564
It looks too smooth.

61
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,234
Two dads.

62
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,237
Dads in space.

63
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:27,482
- It's kind of dark out here, Chris.
- Yeah, it's kind of dark.

64
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,223
<i>Is there any good news about this?</i>

65
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:26,976
<i>Sounds scary, Bob.
You sure you wanna do that?</i>

66
01:33:27,643 --> 01:33:29,520
<i>- Obviously.
- Obviously.</i>

67
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:11,485
How long until they hit the atmosphere?

68
01:48:11,568 --> 01:48:13,778
They go into the sequence in five minutes.

69
01:48:13,862 --> 01:48:15,655
I'm actually here for the deorbit burn.

70
01:48:16,156 --> 01:48:17,616
To make sure that goes well.

71
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:19,826
- Deorbit burn's coming up now?
- Yeah.

72
01:48:24,789 --> 01:48:26,666
Everything's looking good, I think.

73
01:48:28,919 --> 01:48:31,379
Yeah, well, it certainly has been
quite a journey.

74
01:48:31,463 --> 01:48:33,673
Crazy. Here we are, right?

75
01:48:34,883 --> 01:48:36,092
Yes, 18 years.

76
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:39,221
- Are you nervous?
- Yeah, I am.

77
01:48:55,529 --> 01:48:58,156
Cool as a cucumber
because they're not breathing very heavy,

78
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,783
because their CO2 is not going up.

79
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:00,866
That's good.

80
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:31,356
Four G's. That's moving.

81
01:49:32,274 --> 01:49:33,775
Almost like a little comet.

82
01:52:31,244 --> 01:52:33,329
And we're back to seven meters per second.

83
01:52:33,413 --> 01:52:34,413
Nothing.

84
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:35,790
It's, like, sitting there.

85
01:58:52,875 --> 01:58:53,960
Hey, Mommy!

86
01:58:59,465 --> 01:59:00,591
Hi, buddy!

87
01:59:00,675 --> 01:59:02,385
Hey, Mommy, I love you.

88
01:59:25,783 --> 01:59:26,909
See you in six months.

89
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:28,953
See you in six months. I'm gonna miss you.

90
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:54,413
Elon, are you go?

91
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:55,748
Absolutely.

92
02:00:55,831 --> 02:00:59,126
MJ, we're here.
We just spoke to Elon. He's ready to go.
